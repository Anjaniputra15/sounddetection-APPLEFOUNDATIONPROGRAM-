#  Identification of birds by singing app

This application uses neural networks to determine which bird is singing nearby from the sound coming into the microphone. At first, it is determined that there is a sound of a bird singing in the incoming signal. The probability of which is displayed on the indicator at the bottom of the screen. And if it is, then the type of bird is determined and displaying image of detected bird becomes brighter.
It is also possible to disable pre-filtering for bird vocalization by tapping on the bird emoji below ðŸ•Š. For example, to identify such birds as wood grouse and woodpecker, cause they emit sounds that do not fit the category "bird vocalization".
